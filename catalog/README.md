# Item Catalog module

The structure of the item catalog model is meant to be extensible. Default
configurations are stored in `config.py`. Overrides can be set in
`insstance/instance_configuration.py`.

The application can be run by invoking `./application.py` and it will listen
on port 8080 by default.
